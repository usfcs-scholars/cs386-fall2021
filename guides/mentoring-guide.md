## Mentor Responsibilities

One aspect of the mentoring relationship is to help prepare your mentee for their eventual careers. How you go about doing this will depend on the individual personality, skills and interests of your mentee, but here are a few places to start:
* Be responsive to your mentee when they reach out for advice
* Be open in sharing your ideas and experiences
* Encourage your mentee to take risks and seize opportunities
* If possible, invite your mentee to meet your colleagues and peers

The other side of the mentoring relationship is to help foster character development in the mentee:
* Help your mentee to maintain a positive attitude and an open mind
* Acknowledge achievements and offer positive reinforcement
* Be a positive role model
