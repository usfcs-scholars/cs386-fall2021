# Mentoring Overview

Each month of the 2021 -- 2022 academic year (August 2021 through May 2022 with 
a break in December), students in the program are required to schedule
a meeting with their mentor. Students will be setting up meetings constantly
throughout their careers, so this will be a good opportunity for them to get a
bit of practice with coordinating one-on-one meetings.

We will provide a set of suggested topics for each meeting to get things
started, but our intent is for the students and mentors to have leeway in
steering the conversations.  Students may wish to discuss what day to day life
looks like for a software engineer, best practices for finding an internship,
tips on how to learn difficult CS subjects, or perhaps discuss something
completely unrelated to CS. That's all within the parameters and expectations
of the program.

Students will be asked to:
* Respect mentors' time; scheduling and attending the meetings is part of their
  grade for this class.
* Respect boundaries; both parties can 'pass' on answering a question.
* Get the most out of their mentor-mentee relationship. We're extremely grateful
  to all the mentors for offering their time and guidance, so students will be
  reminded to take advantage of it!


## The Students

Our CES|CS scholars have a broad variety of backgrounds. They also have a few
things in common: 

* They are academically talented!
* Many are first generation college students
* Many may not already have a personal connection in the tech industry
* They are entering their third year of their CS degree, meaning that
  internships, upper-division courses, and ultimately the job market are on the
  horizon


## Mentoring Activities

Students will spend time in class preparing for their one-on-one meetings and
reflecting on their conversations. We will also coordinate group activities
throughout the academic year.

Since this is the first time many mentors are participating in such a program,
we will hold informal mentor panels so the mentors can meet each other and discuss
how their meetings with students have been going.
