# CS 386: Career Mentoring and Professional Identity Development
{: .title }

#### Fall 2021 &bull; CS 386-01 &bull; 2 Credits
{: .subtitle .has-text-weight-light }

This course gives students the opportunity to engage with alumni mentors from industry and develop their identities as computing professionals.

Computer science is a broad, diverse field. No matter your background, your hobbies, or your working style, computer science has a place for you. Finding that place and navigating the field may seem daunting at times, but we aim to build a support structure through classmates, peers, teachers, and mentors to make the journey easier.

## Learning and Assessment
{: .page-header }

This section discusses what the students can expect to learn in this course and how the learning outcomes for this course will be assessed.


### Learning Outcomes

Students who complete the Career Mentoring and Professional Identity Development course will be able to:

* Describe their career goals and desired job characteristics.
* Explain the concepts of identity and intersectionality.
* Identify the personal strengths and values that support their career goals.
* Identify ways in which they are or could be recognized as computer scientists by others.
* Identify resources to aid in the development of the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to meet their career goals.


### Course Topics

The course will provide students the opportunity to meet with alumni mentors from industry and will cover several aspects of professional identity development. Topics include defining and building identity, CS disciplines and knowledge areas, and imposterism. Some of the questions we'll explore include the following:

* What does the field of computing include? How do the subfields of computing fit together?
* Who are computing professionals? What are their roles, and what do they do in their work?
* How does one learn to speak the language of a computer scientist?
* How does one develop the skills to practice the computing profession?

We will discuss these topics as a class as well as with alumni mentors.


### Grading Breakdown

The course requirements are broken into several categories. Students must earn above a 60% in each category to pass the course.

**If one or more categories fall below 60%, then an “F” letter grade is automatically assigned regardless of the percentage score.**

As long as all categories remain above a 60%, the final grade is determined by the following breakdown:

| Percent | Category        |
|--------:|:----------------|
|     20% | Class Attendance |
|     20% | Participation |
|     20% | Mentor Meetings |
|     20% | Community Engagement |
|     20% | Class Presentation |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;"}

Additional details on each category can be found below.

##### Class Attendance

Students are expected to attend class on-time and participate during in-class exercises. Students must be present for at least 90% of the class time to earn attendance credit.

Students must attend at least 60% of all classes to pass this course.

##### Participation Assignments

Students must complete weekly pass/fail participation assignments throughout the semester. Example assignments include writing reflections, responding to discussion prompts, providing presentation feedback, and responding to surveys and in-class polls.

##### Mentor Meetings

Students will be paired with a USF alumni mentor and will schedule a check-in with the mentor at least once a month during the 2021-22 academic year. Suggested discussion topics will be provided, but the student and mentor are encouraged to drive the conversations wherever they see fit. Topics could include strategies for finding an internship, imposterism, interviewing tips, day-to-day experiences as a software engineer/product manager/tech lead/etc., or even technical topics.

Students will receive credit for:
* Scheduling and preparing for a meeting each month
* Attending the meeting
* Reflections and discussions after the meeting


##### Community Engagement

Students must attend community engagement activities outside of class. Participation in these activities makes up the majority of the out-of-class work required for this class.

This includes participating in at least one event offered by the CS department (other than CS Night), at least one event offered by the University, and at least one event offered by the local SF Bay Area or technical communities.

This also involves participating in the annual CS Night celebration at the end of the semester. Participation in this event replaces the final exam for this course.


##### Class Presentation

To help everyone get more comfortable at presenting technical topics, students will prepare a 20 minute presentation (including time for discussion). While the topic of the presentation must be technical in nature, students will be given freedom to select the topic based on their own interests. A few possibilities:
1. Present an article about a tech-related topic (e.g., algorithmic bias)
1. Present a technical tool (e.g., a new programming language, cloud service, etc.)
1. Present a helpful resource (programming resources, interview tips and prep, podcasts, etc.)


### Grading Scale

Students must earn above a 60% in each category to pass the course.

**If one or more categories fall below 60%, then an “F” letter grade is automatically assigned regardless of the percentage score.**

As long as all grade categories remain above a 60%, the final grade is determined by the following letter grade and GPA scale:

|          | Letter |        | GPA |
|---------:|:-------|:-------|:---:|
| 97% &le; | A+     | < 100% | 4.0 |
| 94% &le; | A      | < 97%  | 4.0 |
| 90% &le; | A--    | < 94%  | 3.7 |
| 87% &le; | B+     | < 90%  | 3.3 |
| 84% &le; | B      | < 87%  | 3.0 |
| 80% &le; | B--    | < 84%  | 2.7 |
| 77% &le; | C+     | < 70%  | 2.3 |
| 74% &le; | C      | < 77%  | 2.0 |
| 70% &le; | C--    | < 74%  | 1.7 |
| 67% &le; | D+     | < 70%  | 1.3 |
| 64% &le; | D      | < 67%  | 1.0 |
| 60% &le; | D--    | < 64%  | 0.7 |
|  0% &le; | F      | < 60%  | 0.0 |
