## Learning and Assessment
{: .page-header }

This section discusses what the students can expect to learn in this course and how the learning outcomes for this course will be assessed.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

  - Describe on-campus support provided by the CS Department and University
  - Engage with technical communities on and off campus
  - Improve in-class oral communication skills

This course counts towards general electives. It does not count towards the CS major or CS minor.

### Course Topics

The majority of class time is dedicated to guest lectures. Topics fall into one of three categories: department community, university community, or local community.

##### Department Community

This includes activities that involve the community within the USF Computer Science department. For example:

  - Guest lectures or panels from faculty
  - Guest lectures or panels from alumni
  - Guest lectures or panels from CS student groups, such as Women in Tech, the Diversineers, or the ACM Student Chapter
  - Guest lectures or panels from other CS department groups, such as the CS Tutoring Center or CS Support

##### University Community

This includes activities that involve the community within the broader University community. For example:

  - Guest lectures from the Career Services Center
  - Guest lectures from other campus organizations, such as the LWSC, CASA, HPS, and CAPS

##### Local Community

This includes activities that involve the local SF Bay Area or tech communities. For example:

  - Guest speakers or panels from local tech companies
  - Attending field trips to local tech companies
  - Attending local meetups or technical conferences

<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some local community activities (such as field trips and physically attending local tech meetups) have been replaced with virtual or remote options.
{: .notification }

### Grading Breakdown

The course requirements are broken into several categories. Students must earn above a 60% in each category to pass the course.

**If one or more categories fall below 60%, then an “F” letter grade is automatically assigned regardless of the percentage score.**{ .has-text-danger }

As long as all categories remain above a 60%, the final grade is determined by the following breakdown:

| Percent | Category        |
|--------:|:----------------|
|     20% | Class Attendance |
|     20% | Participation |
|     20% | Mentor Meetings |
|     20% | Community Engagement |
|     20% | Class Presentation |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;"}

Additional details on each category can be found below.

##### Class Attendance

Students are expected to attend class on-time and participate during in-class exercises. Students must be present for at least 90% of the class time to earn attendance credit.

Students must attend at least 60% of all classes to pass this course.

##### Participation Assignments

Students must complete weekly pass/fail participation assignments throughout the semester. Example assignments include posting questions for an invited speaker, providing presentation feedback, and responding to surveys and in-class polls.

##### Class Presentation

Students must complete a 10 minute in-class presentation on a significant figure, organization, or event in Computer Science. This category includes several pass/fail assignments: selecting a presentation topic, submitting slides (or other presentation materials) ahead of time, optionally visiting the Speaking Center in preparation for the presentation, and delivering the presentation in class.

<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
Accommodations will be made on request for students unable to present via Zoom.
{: .notification }

##### Community Engagement

Students must attend community engagement activities outside of class. Participation in these activities makes up the majority of the out-of-class work required for this class.

This includes participating in at least one event offered by the CS department (other than CS Night), at least one event offered by the University, and at least one event offered by the local SF Bay Area or technical communities.

This also involves participating in the annual CS Night celebration at the end of the semester. Participation in this event replaces the final exam for this course.

### Grading Scale

Students must earn above a 60% in each category to pass the course.

**If one or more categories fall below 60%, then an “F” letter grade is automatically assigned regardless of the percentage score.**{ .has-text-danger }

As long as all grade categories remain above a 60%, the final grade is determined by the following letter grade and GPA scale:

|          | Letter |        | GPA |
|---------:|:-------|:-------|:---:|
| 97% &le; | A+     | < 100% | 4.0 |
| 94% &le; | A      | < 97%  | 4.0 |
| 90% &le; | A--    | < 94%  | 3.7 |
| 87% &le; | B+     | < 90%  | 3.3 |
| 84% &le; | B      | < 87%  | 3.0 |
| 80% &le; | B--    | < 84%  | 2.7 |
| 77% &le; | C+     | < 70%  | 2.3 |
| 74% &le; | C      | < 77%  | 2.0 |
| 70% &le; | C--    | < 74%  | 1.7 |
| 67% &le; | D+     | < 70%  | 1.3 |
| 64% &le; | D      | < 67%  | 1.0 |
| 60% &le; | D--    | < 64%  | 0.7 |

## Course Policies
{: .page-header }

This section includes miscellaneous policies specific to this course, including communication, attendance, credit hours, cheating, and more. These policies are in addition to the standard USF policies included later.

### Communication Policy

Email will NOT be used for communication in this course.

Instead, please see how best to communicate depending on whether you wish to communicate synchronously (live, simultaneously, in real time) or asynchronously (on your own time, without immediate responses or feedback).

### Student Conduct

Students are required to adhere to the University's [Student Code of Conduct](https://myusf.usfca.edu/fogcutter/student-conduct). In short, students are expected to treat each other with respect at all times.

### Attendance Policy

See the [Class Attendance](#class-attendance) requirements above. Students must be present for at least 90% of the class time to earn attendance credit.

Students must attend at least 60% of all classes to pass this course. See the [Grading Scale](#grading-scale) section for details.

### Late Policy

By default, late submissions are not accepted. However, students may request an exception to this policy. See the [Policy Exceptions](#policy-exceptions) section below for details.

### Cheating Policy

All students are expected to know and adhere to the University’s Honor Code (see the [Academic Integrity](#academic-integrity) section below). In short, students must never misrepresent their work. Examples of honor code violations include (but are not limited to):

  - Lying about your attendance or participation in outside of class activities
  - Having anyone other than yourself complete your work
  - (including classmates and tutors)
  - Copying and pasting content without attribution from the web (or from anywhere)

**Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, a report to the Academic Integrity Committee (AIC), and a report to the Dean.**{: .has-text-danger }

At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This usually involves receiving a 0% on the assignment with no opportunity to make up the lost points, as well as a report to the department chair and your academic advisors. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and any violation may result in an F in the course. See also the [Regret Clause](#regret-clause) below.

### Credit Hour Policy

The official [USF Credit Hour Policy](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sites/default/files/users/kmclemore/USF%20Credit%20Hour%20Policy%2020180726.pdf) states:
  > "One unit of credit in lecture, seminar, and discussion work should approximate one hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work per week through one 15-week semester."

Students should expect to spend approximately 1 hour on out-of-class work every week, with some weeks requiring more out-of-class time. See the [Community Engagement](#community-engagement) requirements for out-of-class expectations over the semester.

## Policy Exceptions
