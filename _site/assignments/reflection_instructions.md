General Instructions for Completing Reflection Exercises
========================================================

Write a journal reflection on the set of questions. 

It is important that you take time to reflect on these questions before writing your responses. Read all the questions completely before proceeding to answer them. 

It is highly recommended to read the questions and write your responses later, ex: you could read the questions on one day and write the responses the following day. 

There is no right or wrong answer to these questions -- the goal is to reflect on how you imagine your future and how that feels to you. 

While you can answer each question directly, you can also write a flowing journal entry that captures all the questions together in a few paragraphs. Donâ€™t feel obligated to answer each and every question exactly. 

Rough length guide: 1 double spaced page = 350-375 words. 1 single spaced page = 700-750 words.
