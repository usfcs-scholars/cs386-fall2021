Community Engagement Requirement
================================

Students must attend *at least four* community engagement activities outside of class. This requirement includes participating in at least one event from all the following categories:

- **A CS department event** other than CS Night. Example events include a talk hosted by the department or an event hosted by a department club.
- **A University event**. Example events include a talk hosted by USF or a career fair.
- **An event offered by the local SF Bay Area or technical communities**. Example events include a meetup or local conference.

This also involves participating in the annual CS Night celebration at the end of the semester. Participation in this event replaces the final exam for this course.

If a student is unable to participate in all required events, for example because of scheduling difficulties, they may request an alternate assignment from the instructor. Alternatives may include viewing a TED talk or other freely available online resource. To earn credit for an alternate assignment the student must receive permission from the instructor in advance.
