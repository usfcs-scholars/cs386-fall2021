Assignment #6
=============

**Due - Wednesday, October 27, 2021 - 3:00pm**

We will begin working on our presentations:

1. Create the slide deck. You can share it with the course staff directly, or add a link to it to your portfolio if you are okay with the draft being publicly available.
1. Create a references slide and add 5 resources that you plan to use while developing the talk. If you have more, add them!
1. Create the presentation outline. This should have details about what you are planning on covering (not just a generic skeleton)
1. Determine your overarching theme / narrative / story and describe it. This is going to help you get people hooked and interested in your talk.

## Submission

Make sure that by 3pm on 10/27/2021 you have shared the slide deck with the course staff or added a link to your portfolio with an "Assignment #6" entry that includes all of the information described above. Incomplete submissions and submissions not received by the 3pm deadline will not earn a passing grade.
