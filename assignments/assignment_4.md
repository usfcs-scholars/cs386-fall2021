Assignment #4
=============

**Due - Wednesday, September 29, 2021 - 4:45pm**

For this assignment, you are asked to find **at least three** ads for jobs or internships you would be interested in applying for in the next year and **at least two** ads for jobs you think you may wish to apply for five years from now. It's totally okay if you have no idea what you want to be doing five years from now, but spend some time exploring possible options. You may want to start with sites such as [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) also has a jobs board, or you might consider looking at [Angel List](https://angel.co/) or the careers pages of companies where you might want to work.

In your portfolio entry, include links to each of the five job ads. For each link, provide a short (2-3 sentences) description of why the job interests you. 

## Submission

Make sure that by the start of class on 9/29/2021 your portfolio includes an "Assignment #4" entry that includes all of the information described above.
